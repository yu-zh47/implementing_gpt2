you can see the setting of paramters in model.py. I made two runs with torch 2.1.2 and torch nightly (single H800 gpu), all other parameters the sam. but I am seeing a significant reduction in memory and improvmeents in training speed. what's the magic?

Nothing “mystical” happened to your script – the difference is almost entirely inside the copy of PyTorch you’re linking against.  
Between 2.1.2 (Nov-23) and the current nightly (what will become 2.3) the core libraries that service your model on a Hopper GPU changed a lot:

1. FlashAttention v2 became the default SDPA kernel  
   • In 2.1 the dispatcher often fell back to the “memory-efficient” path; it still materialises the (B × H × T × T) attention matrix in bf16 for the backward pass.  
   • Nightly routes your call  
     `F.scaled_dot_product_attention(q, k, v, is_causal=True)`  
     straight to FlashAttention 2 when the shapes/padding allow it (B = 64, T = 1024 meet the Hopper alignment rules).  
   • FlashAttention keeps only Q, K, V in SRAM and recomputes blocks on-the-fly, so the O(T²) buffer disappears. With B = 64, H = 12, T = 1024 that alone is ≈ 0.8 GB per fp16 copy × several copies along the autograd graph – very close to the ~30 GB you saw go away.

2. Hopper-native GEMM / Transformer-Engine kernels exposed through cuBLASLt  
   • The nightly build is compiled against a newer CUDA tool-chain (≥ 12.4) whose BLAS libraries include “TC_Hopper_128×…” kernels.  
   • Those kernels keep their partials in registers, so they need almost no external workspace.  
   • When TF32/fp32 paths fall back to a plain-FP32 algorithm (as in 2.1.2) cuBLASLt allocates a hefty temporary buffer; with TF32 or bf16 + TE kernels that buffer vanishes and you also get a ~1.5 × GEMM speed-up.

3. Big upgrades in `torch.compile` (Inductor + Triton)  
   • Static-memory planning and aggressive kernel fusion landed after 2.1. They fuse bias-add + residual-add + GELU + dropout into one Triton kernel, recycle a single workspace across the whole graph, and free intermediates immediately.  
   • Fewer launches + smaller activation pool → more SM occupancy and less memory.

4. Expanded fused-optimizer support  
   • The fused `torch.optim.AdamW` path in nightly now covers Hopper. Parameter update, weight-decay and gradient-momentum live in one kernel, so the three additional fp16 grads/exp_avg/exp_avg_sq are read once instead of being round-tripped through HBM.

5. Minor but additive: better scheduler heuristics, bf16 autocast tweaks, fixed padding rules for SDPA, etc.

Because every gigabyte saved can be turned into larger tiles or more in-flight blocks, memory *and* speed move together: you went from 77 GB → 48 GB and 3.1 × 10⁵ → 4.4 × 10⁵ tokens/s.

You didn’t change any hyper-parameter; the runtime stack underneath you just grew up. If you reinstall PyTorch 2.1.2 with the *same* CUDA 12.4 libs you’ll still see most of the gap close on GEMMs, but without the SDPA and Inductor improvements the nightly will stay clearly ahead.

In short:  
• FlashAttention 2 + Hopper TE kernels slash the big temporary buffers.  
• Newer TorchInductor/Triton and fused AdamW keep activations & optimizer state tighter and run faster.  
That’s the whole “magic”.

Currently I am choosing b = 64, t = 1024. all powers of 2. Using 40 gb out of 80 gb of h800. however I think simply doubling b to 128 is not feasible. but do you suggest me to increase it a bit between 64 and 128 although it's no longer power of 2

Yes – feel free to creep upward; nothing in PyTorch, Flash-Attention 2, or Hopper’s Transformer-Engine requires the **batch dimension itself** to be a power-of-two. What matters for “happy” kernels is that the *matrix dimensions they actually see* are aligned:

• Almost every GEMM in your model is launched as  
 M = B × T               ( e.g. 64 × 1024 = 65 536 )  
 K/N = 768 or 3 × 768 etc.  

 On Hopper the fast TC\_Hopper\_128×… kernels only need  
 M, N, K - multiple-of-16 (bf16/fp16 path) or multiple-of-8 (TF32).  
 So any B that keeps M divisible by 16 (practically, by 8) is fine:  
 B = 72 → M = 73 728, B = 96 → 98 304, B = 112 → 114 688 … all OK.

• Flash-Attention 2 only checks that T is a multiple of 8 (it already is) and that head_dim is 16/32/64 – also satisfied.

So the kernel mix and throughput will be identical whether B = 64, 80, 96, 112…; you just pay the linear memory & compute cost.

How far can you push?

1. Empirical budget  
   You used ~40 GB at B = 64. With the same autocast + FlashAttn stack memory grows almost linearly, so  
 B\_max ≈ 64 × 80 GB / 40 GB ≈ 128  
   In practice some extra buffers appear near the peak, so leave ~5 GB head-room. Something in the 96–112 range is usually the sweet spot.

2. Tokens-per-second scaling  
   Training throughput on a single H800 is *compute-bound* until you hit SRAM saturation or scheduler limits. Going from 64 → 96/112 typically gives another 25–40 % tokens/s. Beyond that you may see diminishing returns because the per-step optimizer and scheduler work scales with the number of parameters, not the batch.

3. Gradient-accumulation alternative  
   If you later need an effective batch > 128 for convergence, keep the physical B around where the GPU tops out (say 112) and use `loss.backward()` every N mini-batches (`optimizer.step()` every N-th) to emulate a larger batch without extra memory.

Rule of thumb

• Pick B so that B × T is still divisible by 16.  
• March up in steps of 8 or 16, watch `nvidia-smi` or `torch.cuda.memory_summary()`.  
• Stop when you’re ~5 GB below the 80 GB ceiling or tokens/s stops improving.

So yes––try 80, 96, 104, 112 and settle on the largest one that fits comfortably; “power-of-two” isn’t a requirement any more.
